##   Project Description

Create a project of your choice and implement it using Code First approach with Entity Framework. You must use SQL Server 2017 as your database. Part of the data in SQL Server must be provided via external files (Excel, XML, JSON, zip, etc.) of your choice. You should create PDF reports based on your application logic. They should consists of meaningful data.

- Project examples:

  - Sports ranking
  - Online store
  - Movie ranking
  - Book store


## General Requirements

- Use Code First approach
- Use Entity Framework
- Use SQL Server 2017
- At least five tables in the SQL Server database
- Provide all type of relations in the database and use both attributes and the Fluent API (Model builder) for configuration
- Load some of the data from external files (Excel, XML, JSON, zip, etc.) of your choice
- The user should be able to manipulate the database through the client (basic CRUD. No need to provide roles for the users)
- Provide some usable user interface for the client (could be the console, WPF, Windows Forms, ASP.NET Web application, etc.)
- Generate PDF reports based on your application
- Follow the SOLID principles
- Write unit tests

## Additional Requirements

-	For the PDF export use a non-commercial third party framework
-	The XML files should be read / written through the standard .NET parsers (of your choice)
-	For JSON serializations use a non-commercial library / framework of your choice

## Optional Requirements

- You could use Repository pattern or Services of your choice or use pure Entity Framework and DbContext (research the options and choose your preferable way to do it)
-   Completely finished project is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly
    -   This team work project is for educational purpose
    -   Its main purpose it to gain experience using Entity Framework in a real-world-like project and to get some experience in team working and team collaboration with a source control system

##  Deliverables

-   Upload a brief video (2-3 mins) of your application and upload it in [YouTube](https://youtube.com)
-   Upload your project in http://best.telerikacademy.com
    -   A brief description of your application
    -   Link the video in the description
    -   Mandatory refer the github repository of your application

##  Public Project Defense
-   Each submitted project will be evaluated by the trainers. Evaluation will strictly follow the above requirements.
-   Each team will have to deliver a public defense of its work to the other students and trainers. You will have only 10 minutes for the following:
    -   Demonstrate the application (very shortly)
    -   Show the source code
    -   Optionally you might prepare a presentation (3-4 slides)
Please be **strict in timing!** Be well prepared for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time. Bring your own laptop. Test it preliminary with the multimedia projector. Open the project assets beforehand to save time. You have 10 minutes, no more!

##  Give Feedback about Your Teammates
